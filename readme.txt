== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Do I need to be a customer of TripleLift to use this plugin?

You can install it and view the code without being a customer, but having the code inject native ads into your site will require that you are a customer of TripleLift. 

2 Will this plugin change the code of my posts?

No. It will inject native advertising between your posts.

3. What's the difference between native ads and banner ads?

Banner ads flash and blank, and come in one of a set of pre-define shapes and sizes. Our native ads are pure HTML, not flash - so they don't slow down your site. They automatically work with the look and feel of your site, so you don't have to design your site around banner ads.
